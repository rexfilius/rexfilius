# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ify :relaxed:
#### I currently work as a Mobile Developer

Beyond working with on mobile apps, I love learning and upskilling as a Software Engineer.  
As a hobby, I build a console application in any language I learn, and keep updating the code as new language features get added. I believe the best way to learn is by building.  

One of such console app, I called it a ShapesCalculator and it has been written in [Kotlin](https://github.com/rexfilius/ShapesCalculator-Kotlin), [Dart](https://github.com/rexfilius/ShapesCalculator-Dart), [Java](https://github.com/rexfilius/ShapesCalculator-Java) and [Python](https://github.com/rexfilius/ShapesCalculator-Python).  

I have been a professional developer for 4 years, and over time I have added languages and technologies to my toolset, and obviously, a lot of experience. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rex_filius) & [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ifykelvinosakwe).
